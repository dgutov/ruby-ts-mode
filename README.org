#+title: Ruby Tree Sitter Mode

* Introduction

This is where I am going to keep notes as I develop the
~ruby-ts-mode.el~.

* Steps

I'm hoping not to forget some steps I did...

1) a. =git clone git@github.com:casouri/tree-sitter-module.git=
   b. =cd tree-sitter-module=
   c. =./build.sh ruby=
   d. =mkdir ~/.config/emacs/tree-sitter=
   e. =mv dist/libtree-sitter-ruby.dylib ~/.config/emacs/tree-sitter=

2) Loaded a Ruby file and did ~M-: (treesit-parser-create 'ruby)~
   which returned ~#<treesit-parser for ruby>~... I guess that's good.
   
3) ~(treesit-parser-list)~ to check the list of parsers for the
   current buffer.

4) ~M-x treesit-inspect-mode~ and it seemed happy.
